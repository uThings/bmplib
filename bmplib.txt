This is a brief documentation of the Pier Luca Montessoro's bmplib
functions that make easy reding, creating, modifying and writing
bitmap files (BMP format, 24 bits/pixel, uncompressed).
See also the example programs.


DATA TYPES
----------
- COLORTRIPLE   represents a pixel; contains three fields (red, green, blue)
- BITMAP        the bitmap stored in memory


MACRO
-----
- PIXEL(image, row, column)    returns a colortriple representing the pixel


FUNCTIONS
---------
- BITMAP  ReadBitmap (FILE *fp);
  reads a bitmap file and returns the data structure representing it in memory

- void  WriteBitmap (BITMAP bitmap, FILE *fp);
  writes a bitmap file

- BITMAP  CreateEmptyBitmap (dword height, dword width);
  creates an empty bitmap structure in memory

- void  ReleaseBitmapData (BITMAP *bitmap);
  releases the memory allocated by CreateEmptyBitmap


HOW TO COMPILE
--------------
- gcc -o <name>.exe -DBMPSHOWALL <name>.c bmp.c
  (both source file and library files - bmp.c and bmp.h - must be 
  in current directory)

- using the script file cc_bmp.bat (DOS/Windows): cc_bmp <name>

- using the script file cc_bmp.sh (Unix): ./cc_bmp.sh <name>
